# Models

Models are generated from the Entity types (property layout + references) and JSON Schema (validations).

The models can have one or more views to filter or transform the model for particular settings (uses) and actions to update the model.

- Use JSON schema to create model layout.
- Add Actions (reducers) and Views (Selectors in Redux)
